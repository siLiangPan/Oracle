1. Performing a Switchover to a Physical Standby Database
Step 1   Verify that the primary database can be switched to the standby role.
SQL> SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;

SWITCHOVER_STATUS 
 ----------------- 
 TO STANDBY 
 1 row selected 
 
A value of TO STANDBY or SESSIONS ACTIVE indicates that the primary database can be switched to the standby role. 

Step 2   Initiate the switchover on the primary database.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PHYSICAL STANDBY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;

Step 3   Shut down and then mount the former primary database.
SQL> SHUTDOWN ABORT;
SQL> STARTUP MOUNT;

Step 4   Verify that the switchover target is ready to be switched to the primary role.			standby 
SQL> SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;

SWITCHOVER_STATUS 
----------------- 
TO_PRIMARY 
1 row selected

A value of TO PRIMARY or SESSIONS ACTIVE indicates that the standby database is ready to be switched to the primary role. 

Step 5   Switch the target physical standby database role to the primary role.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;

Step 6   Open the new primary database.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Step 7   Start Redo Apply on the new physical standby database.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

Step 8   Restart Redo Apply if it has stopped at any of the other physical standby databases in your Data Guard configuration. # 其他物理备库上操作
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

2. Performing a Failover to a Physical Standby Database
Step 1   Flush any unsent redo from the primary database to the target standby database.
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH REDO TO target_db_name; # 主库mount状态执行，执行成功，则能确保数据零丢失

Step 2   Verify that the standby database has the most recently archived redo log file for each primary database redo thread.
SQL> SELECT UNIQUE THREAD# AS THREAD, MAX(SEQUENCE#) OVER (PARTITION BY thread#) AS LAST from V$ARCHIVED_LOG;
    THREAD       LAST
---------- ----------
         1        100
If possible, copy the most recently archived redo log file for each primary database redo thread to the standby database 
if it does not exist there, and register it. This must be done for each redo thread.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE REGISTER PHYSICAL LOGFILE 'filespec1';

Step 3   Identify and resolve any archived redo log gaps.
SQL> SELECT THREAD#, LOW_SEQUENCE#, HIGH_SEQUENCE# FROM V$ARCHIVE_GAP;
THREAD#    LOW_SEQUENCE# HIGH_SEQUENCE#
---------- ------------- --------------
         1            90             92		 
		 
In this example the gap comprises archived redo log files with sequence numbers 90, 91, and 92 for thread 1.
If possible, copy any missing archived redo log files to the target standby database from the primary database and register them at the target standby database. 
This must be done for each redo thread.		 
SQL> ALTER DATABASE REGISTER PHYSICAL LOGFILE 'filespec1';

Step 4   Repeat Step 3 until all gaps are resolved.


Step 5   Stop Redo Apply.
Issue the following SQL statement on the target standby database:
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;

Step 6   Finish applying all received redo data.
Issue the following SQL statement on the target standby database:
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE FINISH;

Step 7   Verify that the target standby database is ready to become a primary database.
SQL> SELECT SWITCHOVER_STATUS FROM V$DATABASE;
SWITCHOVER_STATUS
-----------------
TO PRIMARY
1 row selected

Step 8   Switch the physical standby database to the primary role.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY WITH SESSION SHUTDOWN;

Step 9   Open the new primary database.
SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Step 10   Back up the new primary database.

Step 11   Restart Redo Apply if it has stopped at any of the other physical standby databases in your Data Guard configuration. # 其他物理备库上操作
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;

Step 12   Optionally, restore the failed primary database.
